A Pacman clone made in Unity3D, with tutorials from [noobtuts](http://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pacman-game). In addition to the tutorial, [the original AI](http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior) is implemented with the help of [Game Internals](http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior) as well as menus, global high scores and a basic level progression system.
